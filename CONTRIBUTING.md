# Contributing Guidelines

Submissions are welcome! Here’s a few things to keep in mind, though:

- **One resource per submission.**

    Open an issue or submit a pull request for a single item. Submit tools you’ve actually used and can vouch for.

- **Submit Vitest resources only.**

    This list is specific to Vitest. Jest packages compatible with Vitest don’t qualify.

- **Keep your pull request editable.**

    The final format is still evolving, so make sure `Allow edits by maintainers` is enabled. This won’t affect your contribution credit.
