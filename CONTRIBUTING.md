# Contributing Guidelines

Pull requests are welcome! Here’s a few things to keep in mind, though:

- **Submit Vitest resources only.**

    This is a Vitest-specific list, so Jest packages that are compatible with Vitest don’t qualify.

- **One resource per pull request, please.**

    Submit tools you’ve actually used and can vouch for.

- **Keep your pull request editable.**

    The final format is still evolving, so make sure `Allow edits by maintainers` is enabled. This won’t affect your contribution credit.
